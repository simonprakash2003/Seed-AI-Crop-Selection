# Seed-AI-Crop-Selection
SeedAI is an intelligent crop recommendation system that uses a Random Forest machine learning model to identify the most suitable crop based on soil and climate data. SeedAI aims to support data-driven farming by providing reliable, high-accuracy crop suggestions for sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture.

🌱 SeedAI: Intelligent Crop Recommendation System

SeedAI is a machine learning–powered system designed to help farmers and researchers identify the most suitable crop for a region based on soil and climate conditions. The model uses a Random Forest classifier to analyze key environmental factors and predict the best-performing crop with high accuracy.

🚜 Project Overview

Selecting the right crop is a major challenge in agriculture, especially with shifting climate patterns and changing soil health. SeedAI addresses this by integrating:

Soil parameters (pH, N, P, K, organic content, texture)

Climate factors (rainfall, temperature, humidity)

District-level environmental variations

The framework also includes a simulation module that generates realistic values for missing environmental data, ensuring a complete and consistent dataset for training.
